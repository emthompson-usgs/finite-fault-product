<h1>Updated Finite Fault Results for the Jul 30, 1995 Mw 8.2 Antofagasta, Chile
Earthquake (Version None) </h1>
<hr/>

<h1>DATA Process and Inversion </h1>
<p>
We used GSN broadband waveforms downloaded from the NEIC waveform server.
We analyzed 14 teleseismic broadband P waveforms, 3 broadband SH waveforms,
and 22 long period surface waves selected based on data quality and azimuthal
distribution. Waveforms are first converted to displacement by removing the
instrument response and are then used to constrain the slip history using a finite
fault inverse algorithm (Ji et al., 2002). We begin modeling using a hypocenter
matching or adjusted slightly from the initial NEIC solution (Lon. = -70.31 deg.; Lat. =
-23.36 deg., Dep. = 36.0 km), and a fault plane defined using either the rapid W-Phase
moment tensor (for near-real time solutions), or the gCMT moment tensor (for
historic solutions).

<h2>Result</h2>
<p>
After comparing waveform fits based on the two planes of the input
            moment tensor, we find that a solution adjusted from the nodal plane
            striking towards 6.0 deg. fits the data better. The adjusted solution
            uses 2 plane segments (see Table 1 below) designed to
            match a priori knowledge of the fault (e.g., 3D slab geometry). The
            seismic moment release based upon this solution is 2.19e+28 dyne.cm (Mw =
            8.2) using a 1D crustal model interpolated from CRUST2.0 (Bassin et
            al., 2000).

<p>
Cross-section of slip distribution. The strike direction is indicated
above each fault plane and the hypocenter location is denoted by a
star. Slip amplitude is shown in color and the motion direction of the
hanging wall relative to the footwall (rake angle) is indicated with
arrows. Contours show the rupture initiation time in seconds.

Source time function, describing the rate of moment release with time
after earthquake origin, relative to the peak moment rate (listed in
the top right corner of the plot).
