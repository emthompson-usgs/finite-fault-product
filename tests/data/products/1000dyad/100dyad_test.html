<h1>Updated Finite Fault Results for the May 04, 2018 Mw 6.9 19.3700, -155.0300
Earthquake (Version 2) </h1>
<hr/>

<h1>DATA Process and Inversion </h1>
<p>
We used GSN broadband waveforms downloaded from the NEIC waveform server.
We analyzed 42 teleseismic broadband P waveforms, 28 broadband SH waveforms,
and 75 long period surface waves selected based on data quality and azimuthal
distribution. Waveforms are first converted to displacement by removing the
instrument response and are then used to constrain the slip history using a finite
fault inverse algorithm (Ji et al., 2002). We begin modeling using a hypocenter
matching or adjusted slightly from the initial NEIC solution (Lon. = -155.03 deg.; Lat. =
19.37 deg., Dep. = 8.0 km), and a fault plane defined using either the rapid W-Phase
moment tensor (for near-real time solutions), or the gCMT moment tensor (for
historic solutions).
</p>
<hr />
<h2>Result</h2>
<p>
After comparing waveform fits based on the two planes of the input
            moment tensor, we find that the nodal plane (strike= 240.0 deg., dip= 20.0
            deg.) fits the data better. The seismic moment release based upon this
            plane is 2.8e+26 dyne.cm (Mw = 6.9) using a 1D crustal model interpolated
            from CRUST2.0 (Bassin et al., 2000).

<h2>Cross-section of slip distribution</h2>

<p>
Cross-section of slip distribution. The strike direction is indicated
above each fault plane and the hypocenter location is denoted by a
star. Slip amplitude is shown in color and the motion direction of the
hanging wall relative to the footwall (rake angle) is indicated with
arrows. Contours show the rupture initiation time in seconds.

<h2>Moment Rate Function</h2><br />

<p>
Source time function, describing the rate of moment release with time
after earthquake origin, relative to the peak moment rate (listed in
the top right corner of the plot).

<h2>Scientific Analysis:</h2>
This model still needs work, but the observation of slip aligned on a shallowly dipping plane beneath the rift and the bulk of the EQs seems consistent. Here, I have assumed a depth of 8 km, and resolve slip onto the shallow plane of the updated USGS W-phase moment tensor. Slip after ~25 s is poorly constrained and probably noise. Preliminary GPS data suggests slip may not extend NE of the hypocenter, but I have not constrained the fault plane to eliminate that possibility here.
