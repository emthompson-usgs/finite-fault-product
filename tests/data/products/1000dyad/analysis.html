<h3>Scientific Analysis</h3>This model still needs work, but the observation of slip aligned on a shallowly dipping plane beneath the rift and the bulk of the EQs seems consistent. Here, I have assumed a depth of 8 km, and resolve slip onto the shallow plane of the updated USGS W-phase moment tensor. Slip after ~25 s is poorly constrained and probably noise. Preliminary GPS data suggests slip may not extend NE of the hypocenter, but I have not constrained the fault plane to eliminate that possibility here.
