We used GSN and FDSN broadband waveforms downloaded from the NEIC waveform server. We analyzed 42 teleseismic broadband P waveforms, 28 broadband SH waveforms, and 75 long period surface waves selected based on data quality and azimuthal distribution. Waveforms are first converted to displacement by removing the instrument response and are then used to constrain the slip history using a finite fault inverse algorithm (Ji et al., 2002). We begin modeling using a hypocenter matching or adjusted slightly from the initial NEIC solution (Lon. = -155.0 deg.; Lat. = 19.4 deg., Dep. = 8.0 km), and a fault plane defined using either the rapid W-Phase moment tensor (for near-real time solutions), or the gCMT moment tensor (for historic solutions).
