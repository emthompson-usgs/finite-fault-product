{"inversion_process": ["We used GSN and FDSN broadband waveforms downloaded from the NEIC waveform server. We analyzed 42 teleseismic broadband P waveforms, 28 broadband SH waveforms, and 75 long period surface waves selected based on data quality and azimuthal distribution. Waveforms are first converted to displacement by removing the instrument response and are then used to constrain the slip history using a finite fault inverse algorithm (Ji et al., 2002). We begin modeling using a hypocenter matching or adjusted slightly from the initial NEIC solution (Lon. = -155.0 deg.; Lat. = 19.4 deg., Dep. = 8.0 km), and a fault plane defined using either the rapid W-Phase moment tensor (for near-real time solutions), or the gCMT moment tensor (for historic solutions).\n"], "result": ["After comparing waveform fits based on the two planes of the input moment tensor, we find that the nodal plane (strike= 240.0 deg., dip= 20.0 deg.) fits the data better. The seismic moment release based upon this plane is 2.8e+26 dyne.cm (Mw = 6.9) using a 1D crustal model interpolated from CRUST2.0 (Bassin et al., 2000).\n"], "analysis": ["This model still needs work, but the observation of slip aligned on a shallowly dipping plane beneath the rift and the bulk of the EQs seems consistent. Here, I have assumed a depth of 8 km, and resolve slip onto the shallow plane of the updated USGS W-phase moment tensor. Slip after ~25 s is poorly constrained and probably noise. Preliminary GPS data suggests slip may not extend NE of the hypocenter, but I have not constrained the fault plane to eliminate that possibility here.\n"]}
