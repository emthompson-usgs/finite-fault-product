<html><head></head><h1>Updated Finite Fault Results for the Mar 02, 2016 Mw 7.8 Southwest of Sumatra, IndonesiaEarthquake (Version None) </h1><hr/><h1>DATA Process and Inversion </h1><p>We used GSN broadband waveforms downloaded from the NEIC waveform server.We analyzed 50 teleseismic broadband P waveforms, 17 broadband SH waveforms,and 72 long period surface waves selected based on data quality and azimuthaldistribution. Waveforms are first converted to displacement by removing theinstrument response and are then used to constrain the slip history using a finitefault inverse algorithm (Ji et al., 2002). We begin modeling using a hypocentermatching or adjusted slightly from the initial NEIC solution (Lon. = 94.236 deg.; Lat. =-4.905 deg., Dep. = 23.0 km), and a fault plane defined using either the rapid W-Phasemoment tensor (for near-real time solutions), or the gCMT moment tensor (forhistoric solutions).</p><hr /><h2>Result</h2><h3>The solutions of two nodal planes explain the data equally well. This solution is 2 of 2.</h3><p>After comparing waveform fits based on the two planes of the inputmoment tensor, we find that the nodal plane (strike= 5.0 deg., dip= 79.0deg.) fits the data better. The seismic moment release based upon thisplane is 6.0e+27 dyne.cm (Mw = 7.8) using a 1D crustal model interpolatedfrom CRUST2.0 (Bassin et al., 2000).</p><img SRC="basemap.png"><br /><br /><p>Surface projection of the slip distribution superimposed on GEBCO bathymetry.
